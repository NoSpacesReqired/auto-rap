{"script":I believe, \n
You should leave, \n
Stop being so naive, \n
Just stop, and disbelieve, \n
Your dream to be a rapper. \n
I strongly disbelieve you can rap that good, \n
And I strongly believe you misunderstood, \n
That there is a chance you would \n
Achieve or Succeed. \n
Plus, U ain’t got no robux, \n
not even no bobux, stealin’ mom’s credit card just to get more bucks. \n
All i gotta say for now ;).}
