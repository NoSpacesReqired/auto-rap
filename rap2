{"script":Try to make up your own phrases and rhymes. Don’t use “bars” and “mars” in a verse. \n
Don’t make all of your rhymes "perfect". Use better words unlike "ur". \n
Please avoid using common roasts, like “you have no life” or “I’m a cat and you’re the rat.” \n
Why would you be remembered if you bring nothing to the rapping world? \n
Also, raps don't need to be long, this is just giving you extra time to think."}
